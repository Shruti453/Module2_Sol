                        Lilium (members of which are true lilies) is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants
                         growing from bulbs, all with large prominent flowers. Lilies are a group of flowering
                          plants which are important in culture and literature in much of the world. Most
                           species are native to the temperate northern hemisphere, though their range extends
                            into the northern subtropics. Many other plants have "lily" in their common name
                             but are not related to true lilies.

                        Tulips (Tulipa) form a genus of spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous
                         geophytes (having bulbs as storage organs). The flowers are usually large, showy
                          and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colors).
                          They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and 
                          sepals, collectively), internally.

                        Helianthus is a genus of plants comprising about 70 species. Except for three species
                        in South America, all Helianthus species are native to North America and Central 
                        America. The common names "sunflower" and "common sunflower" typically refer to the
                        popular annual species Helianthus annuus, whose round flower heads in combination
                        with the ligules look like the sun.
